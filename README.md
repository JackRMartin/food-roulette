CPSC 254 Project - Food Roulette

## The Problem


## About 
This project will find nearby restaurants, and it will allow the user to randomly select one. 

## TODO
* Build Desktop GUI for the application
* Find User's Location ( either through an api like Google maps, or we will have the user enter it manually )
* Allow user to specify a search radius
* Allow user to filter different restaurants by cuisine
* 'Choose random' button - that will randomly select a nearby restaurant with the before mentioned filter and radiues
* Display info to the user about the chosen restaurant from the yelp API ( reviews / menu etc)
