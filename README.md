# CPSC 254 Project - Food Roulette

## Group Members - Jackson Martin, Danny Pham, Aaron Gumabong

## The Problem
* Too often are friends and family troubled by agreeing on a place to eat.

## The Solution
* An application that will allow people to randomly choose a restaurant to go to based on location and cuisine.

## About 
* This project will allow the user to find nearby restaurants, and it will allow the user to randomly select one and view details about the random selection. 

## Requirements
* This project was written using python 3.6
* We used Tkinter for GUI development, the Yelp API for finding restaurants.

## Language Choice
* We decided on Python as our language for development. We chose python since the idea for our project revolved around using the Yelp API, and the Yelp API is most compatible with Python. Additionally, there is more documentation and online resources for using the Yelp API with Python.

## Features to include in the application
* Build Desktop GUI for the application
* Find User's Location ( either through an api like Google maps, or we will have the user enter it manually )
* Allow user to filter different restaurants by cuisine
* 'Choose random' button - that will randomly select a nearby restaurant based on user choices and location
* Give Directions to the restaurant

## CASE tools
* We used 'Github Projects' as a CASE tool for our projecct. 
* Github Projects is an issue tracking tool. We used this tool to keep track of what pieces of the project we are currently working on, and what we need to work on next.
